#gbpPrompt 


This is a fork and substantial modification of [sindresorhus/pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure).  Please visit there for more information.

It has been modified for use by [my environment set-up](https://github.com/gbpoole/.gbpEnv).  Significant changes include:

- async display of current pyenv environment

## Install

I use antidote to install this plugin, but others should work.  Not rigorously tested though.

## Getting started

Initialize the prompt system (if not so already) and choose `pure`:

```sh
# .zshrc
autoload -U promptinit; promptinit
prompt gbpPrompt
```
